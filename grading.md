# Lab 5 Grading 

## Makefiles: 13/13

great job!

## Git repo requirements 5/5

nice job!

## Documentation & testing 17/17

README, DESIGN, & IMPLEMENTATION are very detailed - really great job!
Nice job with all of the testing cases! 

## Coding Style 19.5/20

-0.5 your index_build should be broken up into multiple functions instead of doing everything in one big function - this makes it much harder to read and follow! for example, you could have a function index_page that adds the words from the given page to the index, which could be called by your index_build function

## Functionality 34.5/35

-0.5 also you don't need to check if the crawler directory is writable because you're not writing into it - sometimes the directory won't be writable in fact

other than that, nice job!

## Memory leaks 10/10

no memory leaks woo!

## Grade: 99
